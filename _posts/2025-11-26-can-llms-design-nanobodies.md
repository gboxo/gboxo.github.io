🧬 **Can LLMs Design Nanobodies at Scale?** 🧬

This past weekend, our team ran a hackathon to answer this question. We benchmarked several state-of-the-art models and discovered:

- The surprising biological knowledge encoded in present day LLMs, including one OSS model.
- How better performance arises from scale
- A novel benchmarking approach for LLMs with easy operationalization

The results suggest AI could meaningfully accelerate protein engineering. 💡
