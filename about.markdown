Hello! I’m **Gerard Boxó**, an MSc graduate with an interdisciplinary background in Statistics and Bioinformatics based in Barcelona.

My work sits at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Biology**. I am deeply invested in **Mechanistic Interpretability (MI)**, working to decipher the black-box nature of modern machine learning models—from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Biological ML systems.

This blog is a living document of my research journey. Here, I publish:
*   **Experiments** and original research.
*   **Detailed analyses** of significant MI research papers.
*   **Insights** into AI Safety and BioML.

## Research Interests

My primary focus is making AI systems transparent, safe, and interpretable.

*   **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Reverse-engineering neural networks to understand their internal cognition.
*   **AI x Biology**: Applying interpretable ML to protein engineering and drug discovery.
*   **AI Safety**: Ensuring advanced AI systems remain aligned and controllable.

## Current Focus

I am currently focused on **evaluating the capabilities of frontier models for autonomous protein design**.

I have contributed to both **AI Safety** and **Computational Biology**, with past work including interpretability research applied to safety and protein engineering.

## Education

*   **Master’s Degree in Bioinformatics**
    *   *Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona*
    *   Focus: Computational Biology, Machine Learning.
