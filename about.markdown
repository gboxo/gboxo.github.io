Hello, I'm **Gerard Boxó**.

I am a researcher based in Barcelona, specializing in the intersection of Machine Learning and Biology. My primary work focuses on developing and applying ML methods to **protein engineering**, leveraging techniques ranging from Reinforcement Learning on protein language models to Mechanistic Interpretability.

Concurrently, I conduct research on critical problems in **AI Alignment and Control**. I have found deep methodological connections between AI Safety and AIxBio—specifically in interpretability, rigorous evaluations, and applied RL.

This blog serves as a repository for my research journey, where I publish experiments, analyses, and insights.

## Research Interests

- **Mechanistic Interpretability** — Reverse-engineering neural networks to understand their internal cognition.
- **AI x Biology** — Applying interpretable ML to protein engineering and drug discovery.
- **AI Safety** — Ensuring advanced AI systems remain aligned and controllable.

## Current Focus

I am currently focused on **evaluating the capabilities of frontier models for autonomous protein design**.

## Education

- **MSc in Bioinformatics** — Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). Focus: Computational Biology, Machine Learning.
- **BSc in Statistics** — Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona. Focus: Statistics, Data Science.
