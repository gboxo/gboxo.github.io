Welcome to my research blog. I explore the inner workings of **Artificial Intelligence** models, focusing on two critical domains:

- **[AI Safety](/ai-safety/)** — Mechanistic Interpretability applied to making AI systems aligned, controllable, and transparent.
- **[AI x Bio](/aixbio/)** — Investigating how LLMs and specialized models can accelerate protein engineering and drug discovery.
